# Mobile-Price-Predictor-End-End-Project

This is the End-End project Data Science project implemented using different libraries eg: Numpy, Pandas, sklearn etc.

This is the mobile price predictor in which our user will be giving the features which we have asked him to give then on the bckend we have implemented our machine learning model based on RandomForest and based on the given features we will predict whether the phones price is cheap, medium, high or very high. We have applied the hyperparameter tuning to increase our accuracy of our model and we have also used the Kfold cross validation for it.

In the front-end we have used the Flask,html and css to design a front end web thorugh which we could fetch the features from our user then we tried to convert that html into python and then from python to html where it will be displaying the output.
